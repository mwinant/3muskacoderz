## Summary of Game
This game is inspired by the Big Buck Hunter Aracade Game. The player's objective is to shoot as many elk before the timer runs out. A score is kept of how many kills the player made. 

## To Play
After following the compiling instructions, the player will see the Title screen and be prompted to press Enter to start. Once the enter key is pressed, the 30-second timer will begin. The cursor will transform into a reticle and the player will be able to shoot as many deer as they can. When the timer runs out the player will be prompted to enter their name. If the player scored high enough, they make it to the leader board!
